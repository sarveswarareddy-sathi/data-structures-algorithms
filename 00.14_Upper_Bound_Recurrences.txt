Given, T(n) = T(n/4) + T(n/2) + C*n
        T(1) = C

    Cn, 3Cn/4, 9Cn/16,............
    
    --> Geometric progression. But issue is leaf node is not gonna be same.

    --> THETA(logn) --> LONGEST LEAF


Given, T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + C
            T(1) = C    
            T(0) = C

            consider late leaf - upper bound ---> c + 2C + 4c + .......
                n terms
                upper bound = O(2^n)
