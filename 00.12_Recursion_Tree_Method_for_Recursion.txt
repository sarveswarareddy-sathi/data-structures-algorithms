Recursion Tree Method for Solving Recurrences :
1. We consider the recursion tree and compute total work done
2. We write non-recursive part as root of the tree and write the recursive part as childeren
3. We keep expanding until we see a pattern

Example :
    T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + C*n
    T(1) = C

            Cn              ---> Cn
        Cn/2    Cn/2        ---> Cn
    Cn/4  Cn/4  Cn/4  Cn/4  ---> Cn --> T(1)

Count height of the tree - floor(logn) + 1 = THETA(logn)
