Order of Growth --------- Finding efficient solution iven programming problem with multiple solution?

A function f(n) is said to be growing faster than g(n) if 
--> limit(g(n)/f(n)) = 0 when tends to n --> inf
where, g(), f() - time taken
--> f(n) is bad

NOTE : asymtotic analysis always talks about time tends to infinite, eventhough it outperforms for smaller sizes


Direct way to find& compre growths ----------
1. Ignore lower order terms
2. Ignore leading term constant

Example : f(n) = 2*n^2 + n + 6
          g(n) = 100n + 3

    Compare : c < loglogn < logn < n^(1/3) < n^(1/2) < n < n^2 < n^3 < 2^n < n^n
